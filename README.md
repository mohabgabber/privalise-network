# PrivaLise 
### Social Media Network Focuses On Data Security And Being Community Driven Web App

## The Main Idea:
Can you imagine a centralized, but privacy-respecting social network? One that is modern, easy to use, fast and provides security and protection for everyone. That is why we created PrivaLise!

2 factor authentication via PGP, no associated personal information to hack... To Put It Simply: The Web App will not record anything about its users. <br/>
We'll always avoid using any 3rd party software, such as google APIs, google analytics, any FAANG framework (React, Vue...), so rest assured that you will be totally anonymous :D

it's also perfect as an onion service, bc the website doesn't have any js in it, so it can work in tor with the safest mode enabled.

## The Technology Behind It:
   * Python 3.10
   * Django 4
   * Pure HTML/CSS/JS

## Main Features:
   * Sign IN/UP/OUT
   * Can Run On Tor With Safest Mode Enabled
   * Post CRUD With MD Rendering
   * Update Username / Profile Pic
   * Notifications
   * Paginating For Posts
   * Password Change
   * Follow/Unfollow users
   * Commenting And Replying To Comments
   * Hashtags And Mentions
   * Public Profile For Each User With a profle pic
   * 2 factor authentication

## The front-end
The frontend is mostly made (like 90%) by [margual56](https://github.com/margual56)
