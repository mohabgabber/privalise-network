# PrivaLise 
### Social Media Network Focuses On Data Security And Being Community Driven Web App

## The Main Idea:
Can you imagine a centralized, but privacy-respecting social network? One that is modern, easy to use, fast and provides security and protection for everyone. That is why we created PrivaLise!

Encrypted credentials, 2 factor authentication, no associated personal information to hack... To Put It Simply: The Web App will not record anything about its users. <br/>
We actively avoid using any 3rd party software, such as google APIs, google analytics, any FAANG framework (React, Vue...), so rest assured that you will be totally anonymous :D

We also plan on creating an onion version of the web, so stay tunned!!

## The Technology Behind It:
   * Python 3.9.2
   * Django 2.2.22
   * Pure HTML/CSS/JS

## Main Features:
   * Sign IN/UP/OUT
   * Post CRUD
   * Update Username / Profile Pic
