# PrivaLise 
### Social Media Network Focuses On Data Security And Being Community Driven Web App

## The Main Idea:
Can you imagine a centralized, but privacy-respecting social network? One that is modern, easy to use, fast and provides security and protection for everyone. That is why we created PrivaLise!

2 factor authentication via PGP, monero integration, End-To-End Encryption, no associated personal information to hack... To Put It Simply: The Web App will not record anything about its users. <br/>
We don't use any 3rd party software, such as google APIs, google analytics, any FAANG framework (React, Vue...), so rest assured that you will be totally anonymous :D
## The Technology Behind It:
   * Python 3.10
   * Django 4
   * Bootstrap 5
   * OpenpgpJS
   * Jsencrypt
   * Forge

## Main Features:
   Privalise has your normal social-media feature (i.e. likes/dislikes, follow/unfollow, comments/replies, posting) but we've added a lot of other Privacy-Focused features, Like:
   * 2 Factor Authentication Via PGP
   * End-To-End Encryption For users Notes, Messages.
   * No Personal Info For Registration
   * We Added A Mandatory 0.004 XMR Deposit For Every User To Combat Spam, Users Can Withdraw It If They Leave The Platform (It's Testnet not a real cryptocurrency)
   * User-To-User Payments Using Monero
