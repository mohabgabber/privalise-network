                <p style="font-size: large;">2 Factor Authentication is a security setting that helps keep your account secure in case your password was compromised, to sign-in a user must supply username, password, and a one-time number that is generated on every request, this number is presented to the user in the form of a PGP-encrypted message, the message is encrypted with the user's public key that they supplied in their settings.</p>
                <h2 style="color: azure;">How To Enable 2FA?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: large;">To enable 2fa in your account you must supply a PGP public key, and the key's fingerprint, if you already did this, then click on the button below that says "I Understand & Enable 2FA".</p>
                <h2 style="color: azure;">What Are The The Problems Of 2FA?</h2>
                <p style="font-size: large;">Even though 2fa increases your account's security significantly, but there is one down side, <p style="font-size: large;color: orangered; font-family: monospace;">in case you lost access to your private key, it's impossible to restore access to your account, so please backup your private key securely on a usb or in the cloud (symmetrically encrypted).</p></p>
